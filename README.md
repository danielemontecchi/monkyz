```bash
php composer.phar require lab1353/monkyz
```

or, for the latest version, in development:

```bash
php composer.phar require lab1353/monkyz:dev-master
```

And then, within `config/app.php`, include the service provider:

```php

## Artisan Command

**Monkyz** provides the artisan command:

```bash
php artisan monkyz:generate-db
```

This command allows you to automatically fill in the [`monkyz-db.php` config file](#file-monkyz-php-db-php).

It will automatically create all the necessary references to **Monkyz** for the db structure.
Not overwrite already entered parameters: only add the parameters have not been set.

## Creating Custom Fields

**Monkyz** allows the creation of types of custom fields in the edit page of the record.

To create it, follow these steps:

1) If you have not already done so, to publish the views:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Lab1353\Monkyz\Providers\MonkyzServiceProvider"
```

The following command will be published the views files in: `/resources/views/vendor/monkyz`

2) Go to the `/resources/views/vendor/monkyz` folder and create a new [file blade](https://www.laravel.com/docs/5.2/blade),
appointing him as your new field (for example: `custom`):

```bash
cd resources/views/vendor/monkyz
touch custom.blade.php
```

3) Edit the new file as you prefer. Know that, the view, the following variables are passed:

- `$field`: name of database column
- `$record`: the [Eloquent Model](https://www.laravel.com/docs/5.2/eloquent) (to retrieve the value of the field then use: `$record->$field`)
- `$params`: array of field parameters

4) Now you can use your personal type of field, setting the parameter of the `input` fields:

```php
'table_name'	=> [	// name of table in db
	'fields'	=> [
		'field_name'	=> [	// name of field in db
			'input'	=> 'custom',	// <-- change 'custom' with your custom field name
```
